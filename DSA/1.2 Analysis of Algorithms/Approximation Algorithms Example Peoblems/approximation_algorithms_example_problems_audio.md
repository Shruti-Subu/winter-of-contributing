## BRIEF SUMMARY ON THE AUDIO CLIP :

Vertex cover problem , travelling salesman problem and set covering problem all these are NP HARD problem so these is no polynomial time solution to them . However there are few approximate algorithm to them which tend to give us the required solution under few assumptions that needs to be considered.

# **The audio clip contains approximate algorithms for these three problems. **
